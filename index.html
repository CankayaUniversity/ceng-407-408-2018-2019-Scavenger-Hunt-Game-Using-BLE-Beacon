  		<h1 align="center">Welcome to Our Project</h1>
      	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This website inform about our project which is called ‘Scavenger Hunt Game'</p><br>
      	<p> &emsp;Beacons refers to a type of low-cost, location-based technology that use Bluetooth low energy (BLE 4.0) protocol to communicate with beacon enabled devices. In fact, it’s a low-cost 			piece of hardware that acts as stickers and can be inserted on walls, or objects. In other words, Beacons have inbuilt batteries which provide them long read-ranges. Beacon technology enables smartphones to receive notifications or perform actions when in close proximity of an iBeacon. It was Apple that introduced this technology (iBeacon) in 2013. However, Apple doesn’t actually make beacons; in fact, it has developed the iBeacon standard around which beacons can be built. Similarly, Google has its own Beacon standard, namely Eddystone. In this project, students will develop (1) a mobile “Scavenger Hunt” game, (2) a service-based web application that the app is built on top of it for iBeacons, which makes it possible to do all your app's configuration on the web.Scavenger Hunt is a fun game where <a name="welcome"></a> several teams earn points by doing jobs in the task list given to them. The beauty of the game is to collect the highest points by doing the jobs specified in the city, campus or a certain area. The basic idea of scavenger game type is that you can make the locations appear on the map according to specific rules. Players see some of the locations at the start of the game (according to the game creator plans anywhere from one to all locations). Scavenger game type can be set up so that each team sees only one location and every team see different location (rotate start fields). Question pops up when player is at the correct place. Other locations will appear on the map according to timer (minutes from the game start) or according to the rules after answering certain questions. A good selection strategy is a key factor of the game due to the time limitation. What are these tasks?</p>
      <br>Sample Task: go to the library The task details appear when you approach the pre-installed iBeacon in the library: Take a snapshot of Deitel's Java book cover (50 points)</br>
      <p><br>Sample Task: go to the gym When you get closer to the pre-installed iBeacon in the gym, the task details appear: Play basketball in the gym for 30 minutes (70 points)</br></p>
      <p><br>With scavenger game type you can build very flexible games. In this project, students are expected to design a fun game by showing their creativity.</br></p>
